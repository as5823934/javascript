// When an HTML document is loaded into a web browser, it becomes a document object.
// The document object is the root node of the HTML document and the "owner" of all other nodes:
// (element nodes, text nodes, attribute nodes, and comment nodes).

// The document object provides properties and methods to access all node objects, from within JavaScript.
